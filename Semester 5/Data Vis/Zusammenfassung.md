## Definition Chart
Chart a drawing that shows information in a simple way, often using lines and curves to show amounts:
- There is a chart in the classroom wall showing the relative heights of all the children
- The sales chart shows a distinct decline in the past few months
- the TV weather chart

## The Human visual System
![[Pasted image 20250223161719.png]]

processing of visual information works in two stages
- Signal processing in the eye
- information processing in the brain

In a final step, the light reaches the retina, which contains rod (black/white)
and cone cells (color) that convert light into electrical signals. These signals
are carried into the brain by the optic nerves.

The human eye has a small blind spot as there are no rods and cones in the
area where the nerve leaves the eye.

## 3 properties of good chart construction
1. Make the data stand out
2. Facilitate comparison
3. Make the chart information rich

---
## Information rich design
- each figure needs an informative caption
- add legends and labels
- add context with reference markers
- use the different marks and channels
- use faceting to display multiple aspects of your data
- reduce clutter

---
## crafting a figure caption
- title explains the figure is about
- Method explains necessary information to understand the figur
- result if not included in the title

## Visualization pipeline

![[Pasted image 20250223163232.png]]

- Data analysis
	- data are prepared for visualization, cleaning data
- Filterung 
	- selection of a subset of the data to be displayed
- Mapping
	- data is mapped to visual primitives
- Rendering
	- geometric data are transformed to image data
