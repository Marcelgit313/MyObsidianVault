### Vision
**Physical reception**
- Light reflects from objects
- Images are focused upside-down on retina
- Retina contains rods for low light vision and cones for color vision
- Ganglion cells (brain!) detect pattern and movement
$\implies$ No switching between light and dark background
**Size and depth**
- Objects of different sizes and different distances may have the same visual angle!
$\implies$ Cues like overlapping help perception of size and depth
**Brightness**
- Subjective reaction to levels of light
- Affected by luminance of object
- Visual acuity increases with luminance (as does flicker)
$\implies$ Find sweet spot not too bright, not too dark
**Color**
- Made up of hue, intensity, saturation
- Blue acuity is lowest
	$\implies$ Blue should not be used for important detail in UI
- 8% males and 1% females color blind
	$\implies$ Careful usage of colors

Our visual system compensates for
 - Movement
 - Changes in luminance

Context is used to resolve ambiguity

Optical illusions sometimes occur due to over compensation

### Reading
Word shape is important to recognition
![[reading_wordshape.png]]$\implies$ Only **capital letter are hard to read**, don't use for easy and fast reading

Negative contrast improves reading from computer screen
![[reading_contrast.png]]
$\implies$ Use **negativ background for Reading** on screens (= white background, dark text)
### Hearing
Provides information about environment
- Distances, directions, objects etc.
-  Humans can hear from 20Hz to 15kHz
$\implies$ Useful for 3D-Interfaces or Games to convey information
### Touch
- May be key sense for **visually impaired people**
Stimulus received via receptors in the skin
- Heat and cold
- Pain
- Pressure
Kinesthetics
- Awareness of body position
- Affects comfort and performance
	$\implies$ Through touch input we can store information more easily because we saw the direct effect of our touch input
### Movement
Time taken to respond to stimulus: **reaction time + movement time**
**Movement time** dependent on **age, fitness** etc.
**Reaction time** - dependent on **stimulus type**:
- Visual ~ 200ms
- Auditory ~ 150ms
- Pain ~ 700ms
Increasing reaction time, decreases accuracy in unskilled operator but not in skilled operator $\implies$ More Experience = Better Performance

Fitts' Law describes time taken to hit a screen target:
$$t_M=a+b \log_2{(d / s + 1)}$$
where:
- $t_M$ - movement time
- $a, b$ - empirically determined constants
- $d$ - distance
- $s$ - size of target
$\implies$ **Targets as large as possible, distance as small as possible**
### Memory
**Sensory memory**
- Buffer for stimuli received through senses
- **Continuously overwritten**
$\implies$ Only Buffer
**Short-term memory or working memory**
- Scratch-pad for temporary recall
- Rapid access: ~ 70ms / Rapid decay: ~ 200ms
- Limited capacity: $7 \pm 2$ chunks
$\implies$ Easy to remember interface with logical chunks
**Long-term memory**
- Repository for all our knowledge
- Slow access: ~ 1/10 second
- Slow decay, if any
- Huge or unlimited capacity
### Thinking
**Deduction**
Derive logically necessary conclusion from given premises
Example
- If it is Friday then she will go to work
- It is Friday. Therefore she will go to work
**Induction**
Generalize from cases seen to cases unseen
Example
	All elephants we have seen have trunks $\to$ Therefore all elephants have trunks
$\implies$ **Unreliable, but useful**
**Abduction**
Reasoning from event to cause
Example
- All elephants we have seen have trunks 
- Therefore all elephants have trunks
$\implies$ Unreliable: Can lead to **false explanations**
### Errors
Types of Error
- **Slips** = Right intention, but failed to do it right (Causes: poor physical skill, inattention etc.)
- **Mistakes** = Wrong intention (Cause: incorrect understanding)
### Emotion
Affect influences how we respond to situations
- Positive $\to$ creative problem solving
- Negative $\to$ narrow thinking

>[!quote]
>“Negative affect can make it harder to do even easy tasks; positive affect can make it easier to do difficult tasks” - Norman

$\implies$ Aesthetically pleasing and rewarding interfaces will increase positive affect
### Individual Differences
**Long Term**
- Sex
- Physical abilities
- Intellectual abilities
**Short Term**
- Effect of stress or fatigue
**Changing**
- Age
$\implies$ Will design decision exclude section of user population?
